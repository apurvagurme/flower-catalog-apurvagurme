          Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA), is a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical and warm temperate
          flowering annuals and perennials from the family Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most
          species are native to Central America and Mexico but four are native to the United States.

          They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in. The opposite leaves are
          cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins are slightly toothed or serrate. The
          leaves form compact clusters.

          The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and spread in small compound
          umbels. They give small, dry fruits.
