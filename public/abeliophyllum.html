          <strong> Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</strong> is a monotypic
          genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
          <strong>Abeliophyllum distichum </strong> Nakai, endemic to Korea, where it is endangered
          in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in
          having white, not yellow, flowers.
        </p>

          It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, 6 to 10
          cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both above and below. The flowers are produced in
          early spring before the new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long,
          with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm diameter.
